    <h1>UNIT 2: Outcome 1</h1>

    <h3>1.1 - Describe the content and layout of each web page </h3>
    <br>
    <p>About Me page - Contains background image of Starwars pulp fiction with background colour in black, there is a image of Darth Vader/Stormtrooper across 
        the top of the page with the navigation bar below showing links to other content (nav bar has text in pastel purple when hovered over it display link 
        in black and text in white, when clicked on a link it stays active showing pastel green background with white text). I have a heading title ‘about me’ with 
        the content for the web page inserted below (text sectioned to show different paragraphs in pastel green and white). 
        
        I have adapted the same style design and layout of each web page, however the images on each page differ as well as the content for each web page 
        e.g. Unit 1 link shows outcome 1 answers with references at the bottom, outcome 2 page content shows all answers, outcome 3 content shows all 
        answers. Review page content shows structure and style of each web page created answers.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>1.5 - Describe copyright and constraints affecting websites </h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;">Copyright refers to a legal protection of ones original work as the author of that content. Content you have made live online is easy for certain 
        parties to steal and claim as their own, on the other hand websites with written material, graphics, business logo are firmly categorised as 
        copyright material. UK Logo registered trademark and copyright, designs and patents Act 1988 protects creations of literary work, music, art, sound and film 
        which limits what you can add to your website unless you have legal rights for paid content e.g. music, film, art…etc [1]</p>
    <br>

    <h3>1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Accessibility tools such as keyboard only, touch screen and voice recognition are designed to provide people with a disability to access/use a website e.g. speech, visual, auditory..etc 
        People with a disability face vision loss, deaf/hard hearing, colour blindness e.g. poor use of colour contrast on text, background, nav bars, buttons. Adding in shortkeys 
        (within HTML to navigate to links), inserting names for images in the Alt tag in HTML, using text transcripts to make audio information accessible. You can also test your website 
        code for accessibility on https://webaccessibility.com/  so it’s accessible to disabled people [2]</p>
    <br>

    <h3>1.7 - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for website </h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;">These are the file format types I used to make sure my website would run in different web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari), all files named in lowercase as well e.g. .html - Hyper Text Markup Language 
        (defines headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks, lists), .css - Cascading Style sheets (layout structure of web page, text/image/nav bar positioning, < link > tag is used in HTML to link .css file), 
        .jpg/.jpeg - Joint Photographic Experts Group (store saved compressed images to use on your website). These file types are used to create a business or personal website that are made public in a web browser.</p>
