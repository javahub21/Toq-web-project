    <h1>UNIT 1: Outcome 2</h1>

    <h3>2.1 - Review use of IT tools and change of approach as needed</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Using Visual studio for coding (HTML/CSS) was very useful when creating my website 
        as it makes it less time consuming when adding in images from a file path 
        (image location e.g. “images/starbg.jpg”), also body tags (e.g. when typed 
        in < h this lists various headings options you can select from with a open and closed tag 
        < h1 > This is my first heading < /h1 >). Trello was useful to keep updated on tasks 
        To do, In progress and Completed, I found it easier to acknowledge what I’m currently working 
        on and what needed to be done once I completed other tasks. </p>
    <br>

    <h3>2.2 - Describe whether IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;">The tools I used Microsoft Visual Studio and Trello for planning and creating my website were 
        highly useful. visual studio made it easier to create a web project by keeping all allocated files within one folder 
        and push my website Github via the terminal. Trello is simple to use with the Kanban method of To do, Doing and Done 
        (can be edited from anywhere). There are alternative use of software for creating websites e.g. WordPress, Magento, SquareSpace, 
        Wix or a simple text editor Notepad++/p>
    <br>

    <h3>2.3 - Strengths and weakness of my final project</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Strengths - I am very much pleased with the outcome of my website that I have created. The website is simple to read 
        (with font downloaded) and navigation between each web page created. The text structure is paragraphed into each 
        section with two different colours (white + pastel green) and headings for each section, makes it easier to read. 
        The navigation bar I have created so it’s easy to navigate to other pages after reading the content, each link selected 
        appears active when clicked on.

        Weakness - The background image, as it doesn’t really show what it is (maybe a plain colour to make 
        web page look brighter or a better positioned image). Better position of the nav bar, with no gap between nav bar and 
        the image above the nav bar (so it looks more visually appealing).</p>
    <br>

    <h3>2.4 - Describe further improvements to the web project</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;">I can add in sections for each paragraph text, display as a block e.g. unit 1.1 would be on the same 
        row as unit 1.2 content or I could create a drop down menu with unit selected e.g. unit 1 drop down would list unit 1.1, 1.2, 1.3..etc 
        sub content (less links on nav bar if there’s too much content for the web pages). Brighter colours for the background of each web page 
        to make it contrast with darker images, text or the nav bar..etc I could also add other features relevant to the project as well. </p>
    <br>
   
    <h3>2.5 - Review outcomes to match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I made error free pages by making sure each link was tested, images appeared correctly on each web page (where specified in the HTML and CSS code).
        I prepared content to make sure it is appropriate to insert on the website, content writing in notepad and trello. I made sure each HTML page 
        was saved as a .html as well as CSS file with .css</p>
