    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        
    <p>I have been passionate about ICT since high school (year 7). I continued my journey in ICT at college 
        whilst doing As in Art & Design. My chosen area of ICT was web development, thus the course I 
        had chosen was BSc Hons E-Commerce Systems from the University of Salford. Attending codenation was a refresher 
        for myself to get coding again, with the possibility to acquire a job.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:white;">Over time I have come across a range of programming languages and software e.g. HTML(5)/CSS(3), PHP, MySQL, 
        Adobe Photoshop, Java SE/EE, SEO (Google ad words, e-marketing), JavaScript & JQuery, Windows OS, Linux command line, 
        Mac OS, Eclipse, Notepad++, Microsoft packages (Word, Powerpoint, Publisher, Access, Excel), Git Hub 1.7, Xcode (App development), Android SDK</p>
        <br>
        <p>My Interests/hobbies are Formula 1, Cardio, Video games, Web projects, Movies and Music</p>
