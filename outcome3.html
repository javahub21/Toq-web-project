    <h1>UNIT 1: Outcome 3</h1>

    <h3>3.1 - Review benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used (productivity and efficiency)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>With time constraints on developing the website individually resulted in sacrificing further ideas 
        (refer to unit 1 outcome 2 - 2.4), however the web project I created is what I wanted it to look like 
        in terms of showing my flare of design, skills and personality. Working in team would provide more time 
        to learn new skills/features to add to the website, keep track of web project on Trelllo board, address 
        more ideas and opinions about the web project.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;">Having more time to spend on the web project in terms of learning more about features in HTML & CSS. Use of Trello board 
        and Slack more often to plan the web project to get an idea of what can be achieved in a given time frame. Using 
        Trello cards to outline the scope of the web project, initial tasks to be undertaken and backlog tasks that can be 
        carried out once project is completed.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT (Digital projects)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I would use Slack to communicate with other members to share code e.g. if I created a nav bar with links that stay active 
        and other members haven’t then it’s useful to them to add that feature. Not being familiar with the use of 
        Slack and Trello, after using both with planning my web project they became very useful and beneficial for developing future projects.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white;">Making sure all aspects of the web page is working accordingly e.g. links to other web pages, images shown, background image/colour 
        displayed (source link to image in HTML is correct and in the file path folder). Content is displayed as required, with breaks between 
        unit questions and answer. Having drawbacks helped me consult with other team members to fix the issue, giving a colleague my project to 
        test/debug and find errors that might arise. </p>
