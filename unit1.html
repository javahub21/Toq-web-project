    <h1>UNIT 1</h1>

    <h3>1.1 - Describe purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>
        Innovation, rapid growth and better communication provides a 
        business with the importance of keeping the business afloat and engaged to 
        keep up with client/customer demand for their product or service. Communication 
        in business is essential to operate and keep data/information secure, having 
        digital servers means data is easy to maintain with less paper files. [1]</p>
        <br>
    <h3>1.2 - Describe methods, skills and resources needed (What skills and tools?)</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="color:white;">The required tools would be based on business needs 
            e.g. if you want an App developed (native or cross-platform) then you would need 
            a developer(s) with the skills on a Mac OS, Xcode (Swift or Object-c languages), 
            Android SDK, Windows OS…etc If the developer does not have skills to create an App 
            then training can be provided (in house training or outsourced by alternative business)</p>
        <br>
    <h3>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks, making of website</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        I am going use Trello board to plan my website [.https://trello.com/b/xg3e4jFL/website ], I would also 
        make sketches on paper or in a software on how each page would look like (initial design will differ 
        from the final creation of the website with added ideas, changes in development)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>1.4 - Risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">In business most risks are not accounted for within a project e.g. a business will run over-budget, over-time 
            and consistently not deliver the intended outcome. It’s not easy when you to/don’t have ironclad answers to 
            every question as things can change quickly. There are many factors on what causes digital projects to go 
            wrong e.g. 6 months into a website build Apple releases a new version of iOS and the website doesn’t work properly 
            (updated versions of web browsers can also cause issues). Failure to plan the project regardless of the size or nature 
            would result in a business spending more days putting out fires, investing time and addressing risks would benefit a business 
            to prepare for unexpected events that might occur.[2]</p>
        <br>
    <h3>1.5 - How to go about selecting using IT systems and software</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Research is always key to acknowledge which technology is needed for a business. It depends on what that particular business 
            requires e.g. website build you would need a work bench (Microsoft visual studio, Wordpress, Magento, Drupal or a text editor)
            </p>
        <br>
    <h3>1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on chosen technologies help you achieve outcome</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="color: white;">I have used Trello to keep track of my tasks from To do, In progress and then completed. I also added a backlog for work to be 
            conducted once I have completed that unit, then I can move onto the next unit/task. Git/Github is very useful to upload all 
            work online for future reference via visual studio terminal.</p>
        <br>
    <h3>1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects (GDPR impact)</h3>
        <br>
        <p>GDPR (General data protection regulation) conducts how businesses use personal data to analyse customers with digital marketing activities, this becomes 
            more challenging for a business. Gathering information from customers interactions process customers choices of improving products on specific needs. 
            Customers are targeted through one-to-one communications e.g. email, SMS, instant messaging in groups or segments. [3]</p>
